# illya-cord

A simple discord client mod for both the web and browser clients!

## Installation

Yarn is required because webpack is garbage and doesnt bump their dependancies

Install dependancies: `yarn install`

Build debug: `yarn run dev`

Build production: `yarn run build`

## Running

Paste the script into console or use tampermonkey

You can verify it is running by typing `.help` into chat

I will eventually make an injection script for the desktop app and possibly and extention for the webapp
